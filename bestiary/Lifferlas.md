> **Roleplaying Information.** A druid of the Emerald Enclave awakened the tree Lifferlas with a spell. Goldenfields is his home, its people his friends. Children like to carve their name and initials into his body and hang from his boughs, and he's happy with that.  
> Ideal: "I exist to protect the people and plants of Goldenfields."  
> Bond: "Children are wonderful. I would do anything to make them feel happy and safe."  
> Flaw: "I can't remember people's names and often get them mixed up."
