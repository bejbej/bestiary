> **Innate Spellcasting.** Juiblex's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). Juiblex can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  
> At will: acid splash (17th level), detect magic  
> 3e/day: blight, contagion, gaseous form
> 
> **Foul.** Any creature, other than an ooze, that starts its turn within 10 feet of Juiblex must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn.
> 
> **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Juiblex fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
> 
> **Magic Resistance.** Juiblex has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
> 
> **Magic Weapon.** Juiblex's weapon attacks are magical.
> 
> **Regeneration.** Juiblex regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If it takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. Juiblex dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
> 
> **Spider Climb.** Juiblex can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

> ### Actions
> **Multiattack.** Juiblex makes three acid lash attacks.
> 
> **Acid Lash.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (4d6 + 7) acid damage. Any creature killed by this attack is drawn into Juiblex's body, and the corpse is obliterated after 1 minute.
> 
> **Eject Slime (Recharge 5-6).** Juiblex spews out a corrosive slime, targeting one creature that it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 55 (10d10) acid damage. Unless the target avoids taking any of this damage, any metal armor worn by the target takes a permanent −1 penalty to the AC it offers, and any metal weapon it is carrying or wearing takes a permanent −1 penalty to damage rolls. The penalty worsens each time a target is subjected to this effect. If the penalty on an object drops to −5, the object is destroyed.

> ### Lair Actions
> On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Juiblex can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects: he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
> - Juiblex slimes a square area of ground it can see within the lair. The area can be up to 10 feet on a side. The slime lasts for 1 hour or until it is burned away with fire. When the slime appears, each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or become restrained. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, that creature must make the same save. A restrained creature is stuck as long as it remains in the slimy area or until it breaks free. The restrained creature, or another creature who can reach it, can use its action to try to break free and must succeed on a DC 21 Strength check. If the slime is set on fire, it burns away after 1 round. Any creature that starts its turn in the burning slime takes 22 (4d10) fire damage.  
> - Juiblex slimes a square area of ground it can see within the lair. The area can be up to 10 feet on a side. The slime lasts for 1 hour or until it is burned away with fire. When the slime appears, each creature on it must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and slide 10 feet in a random direction determined by a d8 roll. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, that creature must make the same save. If the slime is set on fire, it burns away after 1 round. Any creature that starts its turn in the burning slime takes 22 (4d10) fire damage.  
> - A green slime (see the Dungeon Master's Guide) appears on a spot on the ceiling that Juiblex chooses within the lair. The slime disintegrates after 1 hour.
>

> 
> ### Regional Effects
> The region containing Juiblex's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:
> - Small bodies of water, such as ponds or wells, within 1 mile of the lair turn highly acidic, corroding any object that touches them. Surfaces within 6 miles of the lair are frequently covered by a thin film of slime, which is slick and sticks to anything that touches it.  
> - If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Juiblex table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.
> 
> If Juiblex dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.
> **Madness of Juiblex.** If a creature goes mad in Juiblex's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Juiblex table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more on madness.
