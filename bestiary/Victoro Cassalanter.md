> **Special Equipment.** Victoro wears a ring of protection and glamoured studded leather disguised to look like fine clothing. He carries a rod of rulership shaped like a ruby-tipped cane.
> 
> **Fey Ancestry.** Victoro has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep.
> 
> **Rod of Rulership.** Victoro can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of his choice that he can see within 120 feet of him. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 8 hours by Victoro. While charmed in this way, the creature regards Victoro as its trusted leader. If harmed by Victoro or his companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod can't be used again until the next dawn.
