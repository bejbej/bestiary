> **Rending Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is frightened it takes an additional 22 (4d10) psychic damage. This attack ignores damage resistance.
> 
> **Mind-Breaking Howl (Recharge 6).** The howler emits a keening howl in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area that isn't deafened must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the howler's next turn. While a creature is frightened in this way, its speed is halved, and it is incapacitated. A target that successfully saves is immune to the Mind-Breaking Howl of all howlers for the next 24 hours.
