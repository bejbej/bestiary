> **Fallible Invisibility.** The skulk is invisible. This invisibility can be circumvented by three things:  
> - The skulk appears as a drab, smooth-skinned humanoid if its reflection can be seen in a mirror or on another surface.  
> - The skulk appears as a dim, translucent form in the light of a candle made of fat rendered from a corpse whose identity is unknown.  
> - Humanoid children, aged 10 and under, can see through this invisibility.
> 
> **Trackless.** The skulk leaves no tracks to indicate where it has been or where it's headed.
