> At will: detect magic, spiritual weapon (8th-level spell, 4d8+2 force damage on a hit, appears as a flail)

> 
> **Magic Resistance.** Yeenoghu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
> 
> **Magic Weapon.** Yeenoghu's weapon attacks are magical.
> 
> **Rampage.** When Yeenoghu reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on his turn, Yeenoghu can take a bonus action to move up to half his speed and make a bite attack.
> 
> ***
> 
> ### Actions
> **Multiattack.** Yeenoghu makes three flail attacks. If an attack hits, he can cause it to create an additional effect of his choice or at random (each effect can be used only once per Multi attack):  
> 1. The attack deals an extra 13 (2d12) bludgeoning damage.  
> 2. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed until the start of Yeenoghu's next turn.  
> 3. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the confusion spell until the start of Yeenoghu's next turn.
> 
> **Flail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (2d12 + 9) bludgeoning damage.
> 
> **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 31 (4d10 + 9) piercing damage.

> 
> ### Legendary Actions
> Yeenoghu can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Yeenoghu regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
> 
> **Charge.** Yeenoghu moves up to his speed.
> 
> **Swat Away.** Yeenoghu makes a flail attack. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in a straight line away from Yeenoghu. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target falls prone.
> 
> **Savage (Costs 2 Actions).** Yeenoghu makes a bite attack against each creature within 10 feet of him.
> 
> ***
> 
> ### Lair Actions
> On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Yeenoghu can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects: he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
> - Yeenoghu causes an iron spike - 5 feet tall and 1 inch in diameter - to burst from the ground at a point he can see within 100 feet of him. Any creature in the space where the spike emerges must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) piercing damage and is restrained by being impaled on the spike. A creature can use an action to remove itself (or a creature it can reach) from the spike, ending the restrained condition.  
> - Each gnoll or hyena that Yeenoghu can see can use its reaction to move up to its speed.  
> - Until the next initiative count 20, all gnolls and hyenas within the lair are enraged, causing them to have advantage on melee weapon attack rolls and causing attack rolls to have advantage against them.
> 
> ***
> 
> ### Regional Effects
> The region containing Yeenoghu's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:
> - Within 1 mile of the lair, large iron spikes grow out of the ground and stone surfaces. Yeenoghu impales the bodies of the slain on these spikes.  
> - Predatory beasts within 6 miles of the lair become unusually savage, killing far more than what they need for food. Carcasses of prey are left to rot in an unnatural display of wasteful slaughter.  
> - If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Yeenoghu table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.
> 
> If Yeenoghu dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.
> **Madness of Yeenoghu.** If a creature goes mad in Yeenoghu's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Yeenoghu table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more on madness.
