> **Spellcasting.** The grung is a 9th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). It knows the following ranger spells:  
> 1st level (4 slots): cure wounds, jump  
> 2nd level (3 slots): barkskin, spike growth  
> 3rd level (2 slots): plant growth
> 
> **Amphibious.** The grung can breathe air and water.
> 
> **Poisonous Skin.** Any creature that grapples the grung or otherwise comes into direct contact with the grung's skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature no longer in direct contact with the grung can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
