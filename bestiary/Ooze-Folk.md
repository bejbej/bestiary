> **Transparent.** Even when an ooze-folk is in plain sight, it takes a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot an ooze-folk that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the ooze-folk's space while unaware of the ooze-folk is surprised by the ooze-folk.
> 
> **Fragile Bones.** For each 5 damage it takes, the ooze-folk's walking speed is reduced by 5 feet.
