> ### Actions
> **Multiattack.** The giant makes two greataxe attacks.
> 
> **Greataxe.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (3d12 + 6) slashing damage.
> 
> **Rock.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
> 
> **Variant: New Giant Options.** Some adult frost giants are skilled hunters who con­struct and hurl nets weighted down with fragments of metal or bone. This ability is represented by the follow­ing action option.  
> **Weighted Net.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, ranged 20/60 ft., one Small, Medium, or Large creature. *Hit:* The target is restrained until it escapes the net. Any creature can use its action to make a DC 17 Strength check to free itself or another creature in the net, ending the effect on a success. Dealing 15 slashing damage to the net (AC 12) destroys the net and frees the target.
