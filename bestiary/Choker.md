> **Multiattack.** The choker makes two tentacle attacks.

> **Tentacle.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the choker can't use this tentacle on another target (the choker has two tentacles). If this attack is a critical hit, the target also can't breathe or speak until the grapple ends.
