> ### Actions
> **Multiattack.** The King of Feathers makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can't make both attacks against the same target.
> 
> **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (4d12 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tyrannosaurus can't bite another target.
> 
> **Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.
> 
> **Summon Swarm (Recharge 5-6).** The King of Feathers exhales a swarm of insects (wasps) that forms in a space within 20 feet of it. The swarm acts as an ally of the King of Feathers and takes its turn immediately after it. The swarm disperses after 1 minute. It can't use the Summon Swarm action while it is grappling a creature with its jaws.
