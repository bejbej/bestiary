The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
> 
> **Flame Tongue.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage, or 6 (1d10 + 1) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage when used with two hands.
> 
> **Spellfire (Recharges after a Long Rest).** Magical, heatless, silver fire harmlessly erupts from Laeral and surrounds her until she is incapacitated or until she uses an action to quench it. She gains one of the following benefits of her choice, which lasts until the silver fire ends:  
> - She can breathe underwater.  
> - She can survive without food and water.  
> - She is immune to magic that would ascertain her thoughts, truthfulness, alignment, or creature type.  
> - She gains resistance to cold damage, and she is unharmed by temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit.  
> While the silver fire is present, she has the following additional action options:  
> - Cast the cure wounds spell. The target regains 1d8 + 5 hit points. After Laeral takes this action, roll a d6. On a roll of 1, the silver fire disappears.  
> - Cast the revivify spell without material components. After Laeral takes this action, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-2, the silver fire disappears.  
> - Release a 60-foot line of silver fire that is 5 feet wide or a 30-foot cone of silver fire. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take 26 (4d12) fire damage. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 26 (4d12) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After Laeral takes this action, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-3, the silver fire disappears.
