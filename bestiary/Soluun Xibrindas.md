> **Innate Spellcasting.** Soluun's spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  
> At will: dancing lights  
> 1e/day: darkness, faerie fire, levitate (self only)
> 
> **Fey Ancestry.** Soluun has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put Soluun to sleep.
> 
> **Gunslinger.** Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature or attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on Soluun's ranged attack rolls with a pistol. In addition, Soluun ignores half cover and three-quarters cover when making ranged attacks with a pistol.
> 
> **Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, Soluun has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
> 
> **Equipment.** Four packets of smokepowder and a pouch containing 20 pistol bullets
> 
> **Boots of Elvenkind.** Whilst wearing these boots Soluun's steps make no sound and he has advantage on any Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.
