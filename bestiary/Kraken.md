> 
> **Tentacles.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (6d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.
> 
> **Lightning Strike (Recharge 5-6).** The kraken hurls a magical lightning bolt at a point it can see within 500 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
