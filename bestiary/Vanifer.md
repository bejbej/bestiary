> ### Lair Actions
> If Vanifer is in the fire node while Imix isn't, the tiefling can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Vanifer uses a lair action to cast one of her spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. She can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, although she can continue to concentrate on a spell she previously cast using a lair action. Vanifer can take no other lair actions while concentrating on a spell cast as a lair action. Her favorite use of this capability is casting fireball or hypnotic pattern.
> If Vanifer casts misty step using this lair action, she also draws the power of the fire node into herself. By doing so, she regains 15 (3d8+2) hit points.
