> At will: dancing lights  
> 1e/day: darkness, faerie fire, levitate (self only)
> 
> **Fey Ancestry.** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.
> 
> **Gunslinger.** Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature or attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on the drow's ranged attack rolls with a pistol. In addition, the drow ignores half cover and three-quarters cover when making ranged attacks with a pistol.
