> **Keen Smell.** The kamadan has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
> 
> **Pounce.** If the kamadan moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is knocked prone, the kamadan can make two attacks—one with its bite and one with its snakes—against it as a bonus action.

> ### Actions
> **Multiattack.** The kamadan makes two attacks: one with its bite or claw and one with its snakes.
> 
> **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
> 
> **Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.
> 
> **Snakes.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
> 
> **Sleep Breath (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The kamadan exhales sleep gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if it takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
