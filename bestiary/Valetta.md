> **Spellcasting.** Valetta is a 5th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom. Valetta has the following cleric spells prepared:  
> Cantrips (at will): light, sacred flame, thaumaturgy  
> 1st level (4 slots): cure wounds, guiding bolt, sanctuary  
> 2nd level (3 slots): lesser restoration, spiritual weapon  
> 3rd level (2 slots): dispel magic, spirit guardians
> 
> **Divine Eminence.** As a bonus action, Valetta can expend a spell slot to cause her melee weapon attacks to magically deal an extra 10 (3d6) radiant damage to a target on a hit. This benefit lasts until the end of the turn. If Valetta expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.
