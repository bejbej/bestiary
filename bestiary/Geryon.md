> ### Actions
> **Multiattack.** Geryon makes two attacks: one with his claws and one with his stinger.
> 
> **Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (4d6 + 9) slashing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (DC 24) and is restrained until the grapple ends. Geryon can grapple one creature at a time. If the target is already grappled by Geryon, the target takes an extra 27 (6d8) slashing damage.
> 
> **Stinger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 14 (2d4 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 13 (2d12) poison damage and become poisoned until it finishes a short or long rest. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to half the poison damage it takes. If its hit point maximum drops to 0, it dies. This reduction lasts until the poisoned condition is removed.
> 
> **Teleport.** Geryon magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing and carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.
>

> 
> **Infernal Glare.** Geryon targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. If the target can see Geryon, the target must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of Geryon until the end of its next turn.

> ### Lair Actions
> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Geryon can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
> - Geryon causes a blast of cold to burst from the ground at a point he can see within 120 feet of him. The cold fills a cube, 10 feet on each side, centered on that point. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 28 (8d6) cold damage.  
> - Geryon targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become restrained for 1 minute. The target can end the effect on itself if it deals any damage to one or more of its allies.  
> - Geryon casts the banishment spell.
> 
> ***
> 
> ### Regional Effects
> The region containing Geryon's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:
> - Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the lair frequently see shimmering portals leading to places they consider safe. Passing through a portal always deposits a traveler somewhere in Stygia.  
> - Freezing strong winds howl around the area within 1 mile of the lair.  
> - Howls and screams fill the air within 1 mile of the lair. Any creature that finishes a short or long rest in this area must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or derive no benefit from the rest.
> 
> If Geryon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.
> **Variant: Sound the Horn.** Geryon can have an action that allows him to summon enslaved minotaurs.  
> **Sound the Horn (1/Day).** Geryon blows his horn, which causes 5d4 minotaurs to appear in unoccupied spaces of his choice within 600 feet of him. The minotaurs roll initiative when they appear. They remain until they die or Geryon uses an action to dismiss any or all of them.
