> **Innate Spellcasting.** The eladrin's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  
> At will: charm person, Tasha's hideous laughter  
> 3e/day: confusion, enthrall, suggestion  
> 1e/day: hallucinatory terrain, Otto's irresistible dance
> 
> **Fey Step (Recharge 4-6).** As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
> 
> **Joyful Presence.** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to any eladrin's Joyful Presence for 24 hours.  
> Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the charmed creature, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
> 
> **Magic Resistance.** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
