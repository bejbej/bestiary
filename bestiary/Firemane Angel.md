> **Innate Spellcasting.** The angel's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). The angel can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  
> 3e/day: compelled duel, guiding bolt (as a 5th-level spell)  
> 1e/day: daylight, fireball (as a 6th-level spell)
> 
> **Flyby.** The angel doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
> 
> **Magic Resistance.** The angel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
> 
> **Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If the angel takes 21 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.
