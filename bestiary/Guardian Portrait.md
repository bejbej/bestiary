> **Innate Spellcasting.** The portrait's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12). The portrait can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:  
> 3e/day: counterspell, crown of madness, hypnotic pattern, telekinesis
> 
> **Constructed Nature.** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.  
> The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.
> 
> **Antimagic Susceptibility.** The portrait is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the portrait must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or become unconscious for 1 minute.
> 
> **False Appearance.** While the figure in the portrait remains motionless, the portrait is indistinguishable from a normal painting.
