> ### Lair Actions
> If Gar is in the water node while Olhydra isn't, he can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Gar uses a lair action to use his Multiattack or cast one of his spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. He can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, but he can continue to concentrate on a spell he previously cast using a lair action. He can take no other lair actions while concentrating on a spell cast as a lair action. His favorite use of this capability is casting inflict wounds or call lightning.
> If Gar casts cure wounds using this lair action, he regains the maximum number of hit points from the spell (28).
