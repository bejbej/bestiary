> **Focus.** As a bonus action, the giant can target a creature it can see within 30 feet of it and make that creature its focus. The target remains the giant's focus for 1 minute, or until either the target or the giant drops to 0 hit points. When the giant makes an attack roll against its focus, it adds a d4 to its attack roll. If the giant attacks a different target while it has a focus, it subtracts a d4 from its attack roll.
