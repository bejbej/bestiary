> **Lightning Strike (Recharge 5-6).** The giant hurls a magical lightning bolt at a point it can see within 500 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
> 
> **Variant: New Giant Options.** Some adult storm giants can channel thunderous power through their bodies and release it with a deafening stomp. This ability is represented by the following ac­ tion option.  
> **Thunderous Stomp (Recharge 6).** The storm giant stomps the ground, triggering a thunderclap. All other creatures within 15 feet of the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 33 (6d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the start of the giant's next turn. On a successful save, a crea­ture takes half as much damage and isn't deafened. The thun­derclap can be heard out to a range of 1,200 feet.
