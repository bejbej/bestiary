> ### Actions
> **Multiattack.** The cambion makes two melee attacks or uses its Fire Ray twice.
> 
> **Spear.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.
> 
> **Fire Ray.** *undefined Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) fire damage.
> 
> **Fiendish Charm.** One humanoid the cambion can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the cambion's spoken commands. If the target suffers any harm from the cambion or another creature or receives a suicidal command from the cambion, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the cambion's Fiendish Charm for the next 24 hours.
