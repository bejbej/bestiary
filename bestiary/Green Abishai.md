> **Multiattack.** The abishai makes two attacks, one with its claws and one with its longsword, or it casts one spell from its Innate Spellcasting trait and makes one claw attack.
> 
> **Longsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage, or 6 (1d10 + 1) slashing damage if used with two hands.
> 
> **Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
