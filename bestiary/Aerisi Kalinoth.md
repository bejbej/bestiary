> **Fey Ancestry.** Aerisi has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put her to sleep.
> 
> **Howling Defeat.** When Aerisi drops to 0 hit points, her body disappears in a howling whirlwind that disperses quickly and harmlessly. Anything she is wearing or carrying is left behind.

> ### Lair Actions
> If Aerisi is in the air node while Yan-C-Bin isn't, Aerisi can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Aerisi uses a lair action to cast one of her spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. She can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, although she can continue to concentrate on a spell she previously cast using a lair action. Aerisi can take no other lair actions while concentrating on a spell cast as a lair action.
> If Aerisi casts invisibility using this lair action, she also draws the power of the air node into herself. By doing so, she regains 15 (3d8+2) hit points.
