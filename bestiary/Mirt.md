> 
> **Brute.** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when Mirt hits with it (included in the attacks below).

> **Evasion.** If he is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, Mirt instead takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if he fails. He can't use this trait if he's incapacitated.
