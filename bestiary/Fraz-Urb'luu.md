> ### Lair Actions
> On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Fraz-Urb'luu can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects: he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
> - Fraz-Urb'luu causes up to 5 doors within the lair to be come walls, and an equal number of doors to appear on walls where there previously were none.  
> - Fraz-Urb'luu chooses one humanoid within the lair and instantly creates a simulacrum of that creature (as if created with the simulacrum spell). This simulacrum obeys Fraz-Urb'luu's commands and is destroyed on the next initiative count 20.  
> - Fraz-Urb'luu creates a wave of anguish. Each creature he can see within the lair must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or take 33 (6d10) psychic damage.
> 
> ***
> 
> ### Regional Effects
> The region containing Fraz-Urb'luu's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:
> - Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the lair frequently see hallucinations of long-dead friends and comrades that vanish after only a brief glimpse.  
> - Roads and paths within 6 miles of the lair twist and turn back on themselves, making navigation in the area exceedingly difficult.  
> - If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Fraz-Urb'luu table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.
> 
> If Fraz-Urb'luu dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.
> **Madness of Fraz-Urb'luu.** If a creature goes mad in Fraz-Urb'luu's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Fraz-Urb'luu table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the Dungeon Master's Guide for more on madness.
