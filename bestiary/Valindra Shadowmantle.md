> **Mask.** As a bonus action, Valindra can mask her shriveled flesh and appear to be a living elf. This magical illusion lasts until she ends it as a bonus action or until she uses her Frightening Gaze legendary action. The effect also ends if Valindra drops to 30 hit points or fewer, or if dispel magic is cast on her.

> **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Valindra fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

> 
> **Turn Resistance.** Valindra has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.
