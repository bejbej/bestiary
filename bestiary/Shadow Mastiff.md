> - The alpha has above average (42–54) hit points.  
> - It has an Intelligence of 6 (-2).  
> - It has the Terrifying Howl action option described below.  
> **Terrifying Howl.** The shadow mastiff howls. Any beast or humanoid within 300 feet of the mastiff and able to hear its howl must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to any shadow mastiff's Terrifying Howl for the next 24 hours.
