> At will: clairvoyance, crown of madness, major image, suggestion  
> 1e/day: confusion, mass suggestion

> **Aura of Mind Erosion.** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the sire must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this aura for the next 24 hours.

At the start of each of its turns, the sire can suppress this aura until the start of its next turn.
