> **Innate Spellcasting.** The archon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). The archon can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:  
> At will: detect evil and good  
> 1e/day: destructive wave, geas
> 
> **Angelic Weapons.** The archon's weapon attacks are magical. When the archon hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 3d8 radiant damage (included in the attack).
> 
> **Axiomatic Mind.** The archon can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its understanding of justice.
> 
> **Magic Resistance.** The archon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
> 
> **One Being.** Though it appears as a humanoid creature riding a mount, an archon is a single being. The "rider" can't be dismounted, and no other means can separate the two portions of the archon's being short of its death.
