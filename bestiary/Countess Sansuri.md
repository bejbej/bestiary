> ### Actions
> **Fling.** Sansuri tries to throw a Small or Medium creature within 10 feet of her. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be hurled up to 60 feet horizontally in a direction of Sansuri's choice and land prone, taking 1d8 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown.
> 
> **Wind Aura.** A magical aura of wind surrounds Sansuri. The aura is a 10-foot-radius sphere that lasts as long as Sansuri maintains concentration on it (as if concentrating on a spell). While the aura is in effect, Sansuri gains a +2 bonus to its AC against ranged weapon attacks, and all open flames within the aura are extinguished unless they are magical.
> 
> **Multiattack.** Sansuri makes two spear attacks.
> 
> **Morningstar.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) piercing damage.
> 
> **Rock.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
