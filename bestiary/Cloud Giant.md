> ### Actions
> **Multiattack.** The giant makes two morningstar attacks.
> 
> **Morningstar.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) piercing damage.
> 
> **Rock.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
> 
> **Variant: New Giant Options.** Some adult cloud giants have the magical ability to cre­ate barriers of gale-force wind around themselves that can deflect incoming missiles. Others like to fling ene­mies through the air. These abilities are represented by the following action options.  
> **Fling.** The giant tries to throw a Small or Medium creature within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be hurled up to 60 feet horizontally in a direction of the giant's choice and land prone, taking 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown.  
> **Wind Aura.** A magical aura of wind surrounds the giant. The aura is a 10-foot-radius sphere that lasts as long as the giant maintains concentration on it (as if concentrating on a spell). While the aura is in effect, the giant gains a +2 bonus to its AC against ranged weapon attacks, and all open flames within the aura are extinguished unless they are magical.
