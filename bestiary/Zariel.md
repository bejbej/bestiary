> **Regeneration.** Zariel regains 20 hit points at the start of her turn. If she takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn. Zariel dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

> **Multiattack.** Zariel attacks twice with her longsword or with her javelins. She can substitute Horrid Touch for one of these attacks.
> 
> **Longsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) slashing damage plus 36 (8d8) fire damage, or 19 (2d10 + 8) slashing damage plus 36 (8d8) fire damage if used with two hands.

While poisoned in this way, the target is also blinded and deafened. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

> 
> **Immolating Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).** Zariel turns her magical gaze toward one creature she can see within 120 feet of her and commands it to combust. The target must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (4d10) fire damage.

> ***
> 
> ### Lair Actions
> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zariel can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:
> - Zariel casts major image four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the spell. Zariel prefers to create images of intruders' loved ones being burned alive. Zariel doesn't need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round. Each creature that can see these illusions must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the illusion for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
> - Zariel casts her innate fireball spell.
> 
> ***
> 
> ### Regional Effects
> The region containing Zariel's lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:
> - The area within 9 miles of the lair is filled with screaming voices and the stench of burning meat.  
> - Once every 60 feet within 1 mile of the lair, 10-foot-high gouts of flame rise from the ground. Any creature or object that touches the flame takes 7 (2d6) fire damage, though it can take this damage no more than once per round.  
> - The area within 2 miles, but no closer than 500 feet, of the lair is filled with smoke, which causes the area to be heavily obscured. The smoke can't be cleared away.
> 
> If Zariel dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.
