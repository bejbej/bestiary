> ### Actions
> **Multiattack.** The drow makes three death lance attacks.
> 
> **Death Lance.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it takes. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.
> 
> **Variant: Demon Summoning.** Some drow inquisitors have an action that allows them to summon a demon.  
> **Summon Demon (1/Day).** The drow attempts to magically summon a yochlol, with a 50 percent chance of success. If the attempt fails, the drow takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage. Otherwise, the summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 10 minutes, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action. (see notes for link)
